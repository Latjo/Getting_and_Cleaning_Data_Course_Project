The script, run_analysis.R, requires the working directory to be set to the samung data (folder name: "UCI HAR Dataset").

If run, the script takes data from various text files located in the folder and produces a tidy data frame, showing the result of 88 different mean and standard deviation measurements per activity and individual.

The script also produces another data frame, derived from the first, which shows the averages of the values in the first data frame, per activity and individual.

For details, please follow along the comments in the script file.
